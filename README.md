TASK 4: Business Problem Optimization using PuLP

Task 4 revolved around solving a real-world business problem using optimization techniques—specifically, linear programming (LP) with the help of the PuLP library in Python. The problem was formulated around maximizing profit for a furniture company that manufactures chairs and tables under resource constraints.

The business scenario involved defining decision variables, constraints, and an objective function. Each chair required 4 units of wood and 2 hours of labor, while each table needed 3 units of wood and 4 hours of labor. The company had a limited supply of 240 units of wood and 160 hours of labor. The profit was ₹20 per chair and ₹30 per table. The objective was to determine how many chairs and tables should be produced to maximize total profit.

I used PuLP to define the LP problem as a maximization task. The decision variables—number of chairs and tables—were constrained to be non-negative integers. The objective function, which calculates total profit, was defined as 20 * chairs + 30 * tables. The resource constraints were implemented using inequality expressions representing wood and labor limits.

Once the model was formulated, I used PuLP’s built-in solver to find the optimal solution. The solver provided the number of chairs and tables to produce and the maximum profit achievable under the given constraints. According to the results, the company should produce 30 chairs and 10 tables to achieve the highest profit of ₹900.

This task demonstrated the power of mathematical optimization in decision-making. I learned how to translate a business scenario into a mathematical model, apply constraints logically, and solve for the best outcome. PuLP made it easy to define and solve the LP problem using a Pythonic interface.

Overall, Task 4 strengthened my problem-solving skills, especially in formulating and solving optimization problems programmatically. It also showed how data science can be applied to traditional business domains like operations and logistics, proving the versatility and impact of data-driven decision-making.
